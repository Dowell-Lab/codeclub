## Tfit Code Club

## Powerpoints
* Hope's [powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lqaEEtVl42s4XPr4xcGARAjMnjV-V6AZ5A56Ba8hL0g/edit?usp=sharing) in understanding how to run Tfit and what the different outputs are (10/29/24)

## Code
* [Bidirectional-Flow](https://github.com/Dowell-Lab/Bidirectional-Flow/tree/Tfit_focus) is a nextflow pipeline developed by the lab that runs Tfit with the workarounds of the bugs.
  * There are two branches: Master is the original and Tfit_focus has the edits for running with point-based bedgraphs and using 800,000 bidirectionals as additional prelim regions.
